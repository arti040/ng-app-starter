# App Starter 2.0
My little boilerplate for apps and SPA websites based on Webpack 2.x


## How to run it:
1. clone or download this repo
2. do npm install
3. npm start -> localhost:8080
4. npm run build -> /dist/

(see webpack.opts.js for additional config options)

TODO: 
- Karma/Jasmine - add run scripts in Webpack config;
- Fix access to Bootstrap variables
